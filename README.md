BannerBoat – Custom Banners on Boats

BannerBoat is a lightweight and intuitive Minecraft plugin that allows players to attach banners to the backs of boats, giving you a fun way to decorate and personalize your watercraft. Whether you’re roleplaying, racing, or just cruising across your server’s rivers and oceans, BannerBoat makes your boats stand out in style.

Features

Attach banners to boats: Simply right-click a boat while holding any banner, and it will attach perfectly to the back of the boat.

Automatic alignment: The banner automatically follows the boat’s direction, staying in place as you steer.

Full-size banners: Display your full designs without scaling issues.

Drops banners on boat break: No accidental loss—banners are safely dropped when the boat is destroyed.

Lightweight and efficient: Runs smoothly on Paper and Spigot servers without causing lag.

Configurable offsets: Adjust the banner’s position relative to the boat using a simple config file for the perfect look.

How It Works

BannerBoat uses invisible ArmorStands to hold the banner behind the boat. This allows the banner to move seamlessly with the boat while remaining untouchable during normal gameplay. Only right-clicking a boat with a banner in hand will place it; there is no way to remove it directly, ensuring that banners stay secure until the boat is destroyed.

How to Use

Install the plugin: Place the BannerBoat.jar into your server’s plugins folder and restart the server.

Configure (optional): Open the generated config.yml to adjust the banner’s back and y offsets for perfect placement.

Attach a banner: Hold any banner in your hand and right-click a boat. The banner will attach to the back.

Enjoy your decorated boats: Cruise, race, or roleplay with custom banners following your boats.

Retrieve banners: When a boat is destroyed, the banner will drop as an item, ready to be reused.

Example Use Cases

PvP servers: Mark teams with banner designs on boats.

Adventure maps: Decorate boats with themed banners for quests.

Creative servers: Showcase custom designs while riding your boats.
